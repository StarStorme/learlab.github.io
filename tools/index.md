Our work wouldn't be possible without the contributions of hundreds of other labs. Here are some tools and resources that we have developed for the research community.

Along with colleagues at the University of Oregon (Kris Kyle), Arizona State University (Danielle McNamara), and Georgia State University (Joon Suh Choi), we have developed a number of tools that can be used to automatically extract linguistic features, language components, and readability formulas from texts.

The tools focus on the following features
- Lexical sophistication (TAALES)
- Text Cohesion (TAACO)
- Syntactic Complexity (TAASSC)
- Lexical Diversity (TAALED)
- Sentiment Analysis (SEANCE)
- Text Readability (ARTE)
- Grammatical Complexity (GAMET)

The developed tools are freely available on linguisticanalysistool.org
