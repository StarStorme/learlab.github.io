# <i class="fas fa-tools"></i>Datasets and Competitions

Our research team creates large datasets that are publicly available. We lead analyses of these and other datasets using NLP techniques and host competitions to attract world-wide talent into learning analytics. We also use large datasets to fine-tune and domain adapt language models to inform educational interventions.
